# PROD-ALERT-2
Psychiatric Restraint Open Data Analysis using Logarithmic Estimate of Reporting Trends

Repository for the second iteration of PROD-ALERT.

The project uses statistical methods to describe patterns in reporting of restraint in Enlgish Mental Health providers.

This repository is written in real time and openly by the sole author.
The only changes to method since the first paper are neater/faster ways of doing things, the basic methods are the same.

In all providers reporting restraint in the legally mandated open data, size and detentions correlated with restraint.
Many large providers claimed no restraint for a whole year September 2020-August 2022 in that open data.
