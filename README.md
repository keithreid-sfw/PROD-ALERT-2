# PROD-ALERT-2
Psychiatric Restraint Open Data Analysis using Logarithmic Estimate of Reporting Trends part 2
Repository for the second iteration of PROD-ALERT.
The project uses statistical methods to describe patterns in reporting of restraint in English Mental Health providers.

This repository is written in real time and openly by the sole author in Python, to be accessible to most coders.
The previous repository now called PROD-ALERT 1 remains available and is on Excel but is now obsolete.
The only changes to method since the first paper are neater/faster/clearer ways of doing things.
The basic methods are the same.

In all providers reporting restraint in the legally mandated open data, size and detentions correlated with restraint.
Many large providers claimed no restraint for a whole year September 2020-August 2021 in that open data.
Some ahve joined in and their restraint is as prediucted by PROD-ALERT 1.
