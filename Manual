Dear Reader

Thank you for coming to PROD-ALERT-2. This is the manual.

ORGINAL PAPER
If you wish to read the original paper you can get it here:

THIS ADVICE
This advice exists for clairity and to allow others to replciate PROD-ALERT projects.
The activity here starts up after I downloaded and cleaned the files.
Cleaning the files means taking out all the extra information.
First you ge the files.

GETTING FILES
Get the files from here:

  https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-services-monthly-statistics

CLEANING FILES
The files here in this repository are cleaned.
One really has to clean them before they are uploadable because they are very big and GitHub won't accept them.
Sort columns "breakdown" and delete everything in that column except "provider".
Similarly we delete everything except headline counts per month for these, leaving one simple file for each per month:

  people subject to detention at the end of the reporting peroid
  people subject to restraint during the reporting period
  bed bed days per month

WHAT IS THE TIMELINE
The timeline is the next year after the previous PROD-ALERT.
That is to say it is the twelve months September 2021 to August 2022.

WHAT IS A PROVIDER
Providers have bed days more than zero in at least one month in the year under analysis.
